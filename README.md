I used to have a page called Poker's Diary and each entry of the diary would be a simple HTML + CSS webpage made from a set form. This is a script automating making new entries in the now deprecated diary. Done as a simple Python exercise.

# Disclaimer:
This was done at the very beginning of my Python journey and is probably the first non-tutorial piece of code that I wrote that worked. This is the reason I'm keeping it as-is (so awful) for archivization purposes.
